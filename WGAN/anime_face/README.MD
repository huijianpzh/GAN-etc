## anime face
This is an implementation of WGAN to generate the anime faces.

I try to use WGAN here to generate the anime faces here.
And the network architecture is DCGAN. 

#### Enviroment
* pytorch 0.4.0
* Anaconda python 3.6.4

#### Data
You can find the [data](https://github.com/chenyuntc/pytorch-book/tree/master/chapter7-GAN%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E5%8A%A8%E6%BC%AB%E5%A4%B4%E5%83%8F) here and download it.

#### Result
This is the result after about 150 epochs.

#### TO DO
* I should train it and try to get a better result. Especially, the parameters should be adjusted, for the training process is sitll unstable.
